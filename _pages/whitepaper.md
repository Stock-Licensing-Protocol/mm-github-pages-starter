# Introduction

The stock asset market was estimated to be 3.3 billion USD in 2020 and projected
to grow to 4.8 billion USD by 2028 [[1]](https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/market-insight/stock-photography-market-4549). Currently the stock asset industry is
bogged down by the inefficiencies of centralization which is limiting the growth
of the industry. Decentralized technologies like NFTs can be used to solve these
inefficiencies but not in their current form.

## Stock Asset Agencies

The stock asset industry is an oligopoly controlled by a small number of large
companies that act as agencies between stock asset creators and buyers. These
agencies markup the price of stock assets by 200%-1000%. This complex and
unnecessary system of middlemen has created an inefficient market with a lack of
innovation in recent years. The technology platforms of these middlemen are
built on web 2.0 technologies and would be made significantly more efficient
using decentralized technologies, benefiting both stock asset creators,
marketplaces and buyers.

## Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT)

The non-fungible token market size reached 50 billion USD in 2021 and is
forecast to grow to 130 billion by 2028 [[2]](https://www.emergenresearch.com/industry-report/non-fungible-token-market). In 2021 the majority of NFTs
revenue were collectable NFTs developed with the ERC721 or ERC1155 NFT standard.
The collectable NFT standards are not useful for licensing because royalty fees
are not honored between different marketplaces and the NFTs are freely
transferable. However, ERC721 and ERC1155 can be implemented with modifications
to make them suitable for licensing any stock asset.

## Solution

To facilitate creativity and growth of the stock industry it needs a new model
and technology to license digital assets. The rest of this whitepaper will
describe a decentralized stock licensing protocol based around a stock licensing
NFT. The stock licensing NFT will use a blockchain to manage stock asset
payments and licensing. To achieve this, decentralized technologies will be used
to disintermediate the stock asset middlemen creating more efficient
marketplaces for stock assets.

When a creator mints a stock licensing NFT, they are giving anyone permission to
sell a license for the price specified when minting the NFT. This will create a
collection of stock photos, videos, and other creative assets that can be sold
by any marketplace in a decentralized way. The entire stock asset ecosystem can
be rebuilt with an open-source protocol managed by a decentralized autonomous
organization (DAO) based on tokenomics incentives.
