# Token Economics

The Stock Licensing Protocol Token will have a fixed supply of one billion
tokens. There will be two primary uses for the token:

1.  Required to create every Stock Licensing NFT
2.  Participate in the Stock Licensing Protocol DAO

However, future token uses may be added to the protocol as it matures.
Additional possible uses for the token include:

1.  Using tokens to increase search results for a Stock Licensing NFT
2.  Use in the decentralized DMCA take down and spam reporting process

## Token Distribution

The initial planned token distribution is listed below however this may change
before the token contract is deployed without notice.

20% - Development Team and Initial Investors

20% - Early Creative Contributors

20% - Incentives and marketing for Initial Buyers

15% - Development grants, partnerships and bounties

15% - DAO treasury and emergency fund

10% - Liquidity Pools and LP Mining

### Development Team and Initial Investors

The initial development of the protocol will be financed with one fifth of the
tokens. The development team will be allocated tokens and sales of a small
portion of the tokens to initial investors will raise funds to increase the
speed of development and pay for other fees related to releasing the first
version of the protocol.

### Early Creative Contributors

Creators will be incentivized to upload their pre-existing stock assets to the
protocol with free Stock Licensing Protocol tokens. A process will be developed
to incentivize creators to use the tokens to mint Stock Licensing NFT with their
free tokens rather than hold for future gains or sell immediately. This will
also control access to who can mint Stock Licensing NFTs while the collection is
being populated to reduce spam and copyright infringement.

### Incentives and Marketing for Initial Buyers

Buyers will also be incentivized to purchase Non-Fungible Licenses with tokens.
One fifth of the tokens will be used to market to stock buyers and provide
incentives for buyers to use the protocol.

An example of how these tokens will be used is to buy License Credits with the
tokens, essentially giving an initial set of free stock licenses to buyers
similar to how stock agencies provide free licenses for joining their platforms.
However, when the License Credit is redeemed for a license, the creator will
receive the Stock Licensing Protocol Tokens. The result of this is creators of
the most marketable stock assets will accumulate a larger percentage of stock
licensing protocol tokens giving them a larger say in the governance of the
protocol.

### Development Grants, Partnerships and Bounties

The Stock Licensing Protocol can only be successful with a strong development
community. A portion of the tokens will be reserved for rewarding and
incentivizing participation in the development and growth of the community. This
would include engaging and incentivizing existing Web 2.0 companies and
applications to integrate with the Stock Licensing Protocol.

### DAO Treasury and Emergency Fund

The Stock Licensing Protocol DAO will receive tokens for initial funding. This
will create the initial treasury which will be directed by protocol improvement
proposals. It is expected that this treasury with the protocol fees will be used
to maintain the protocol after the initial development has been completed.

### Liquidity Pools and LP Mining

Initially tokens will be distributed to creators and license buyers for free to
incentivize early use of the protocol. However, after the initial distribution
Stock Licensing Protocol tokens will need to be purchased by creators to mint
Stock Licensing NFTs. These tokens will be available for purchase on
decentralized exchanges. A portion of tokens will be set aside for liquidity
pools and to incentivize token owners to provide liquidity to these pools.

## Token Release Schedule

The initial planned token release schedule is outlined below but this may change
before the token contract is deployed without notice.

**Development Team and Initial Investors** - 2 years monthly even distribution

**Early Creative Contributors** - 2 years monthly even distribution

**Incentives and Marketing for Initial Buyers** - 4 years monthly even
distribution

**Development Grants, Partnerships and Bounties** - 4 years monthly even
distribution

**DAO Treasury and Emergency Fund** - 4 years monthly even distribution

**Liquidity Pools and LP Mining** - Released at listing decentralized listing

Assuming the decentralized listing is completed after 12 months the release
schedule will look like the following.
